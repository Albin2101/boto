AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that enables Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
customers to manage users and user permissions in AWS. The service is targeted at organizations with 
multiple users or systems in the cloud that use AWS products such as Amazon EC2, Amazon SimpleDB, and 
the AWS Management Console. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as 
access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users can access.

You can use the following examples to access AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) using the 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python.
For more information about IAM,  see the `IAM documentation <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/iam/>`_.
